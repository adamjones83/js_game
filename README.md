# js_game
part of an engine for a silly RPG style javascript game - hosted in an HTM
* uses JQuery, mostly homemade images, coded from scratch
* made around 2009
* javascript based, but hosted with an HTM

download the folder, and run the HTM - use ASDF to move around, and some of the buttons do something.  Imagine that this was working toward a cheesy RPG in the style of "Castle of the Winds"
