SCENARIO #1:
You are in the middle of a battle.  The 2 opposing 
camps are on opposite sides of a battlefield.  Many 
soldiers are fighting with each other.  Should I have 
2 ai's (good vs bad) or all unique?

This scenario is complete when you can kill the commander
who is able to spawn more soldiers.  You lose when your
commander is killed.

SCENARIO #2:
You come home victorious only to find that your family is
gone.  Clues lead you to search for them, and eventually 
find them in a city.  You win when you successfully can
get them out of the city and safely back home.
